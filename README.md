This is the repository for USNA CS/IT Department 2016 Capstone Group 5

The purpose of this project is to do signals processing for three signals on an Android device.

#Signals
1. ACARS
2. End-of-Train Device
3. Handheld Radio

#Progress
As of right now, we have bytestreams for each signal and a prototype interface to work with.  The next steps involve demodulating, decoding, and parsing the raw bytes we receive from the SDR.
